**At-a-Glance üëÄ**

We studied the potential benefits of direct interaction and virtual reality (VR) for data transformation. We compared gesture interaction vs. a standard WIMP user interface, each on the desktop and in VR. With the tested data and tasks, we found time performance was similar between desktop and VR. Meanwhile, VR demonstrates preliminary evidence to better support provenance and sense-making throughout the data transformation process.


**Motivation ü§î**

As computational notebooks become more complex, navigating and comparing analytical workflows in traditional desktop environments presents significant challenges. Analysts often struggle with linear execution, inefficient navigation, and limited comparison capabilities.


**Solution üí° (demo-video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnA2PpYqMlA)**

We developed an interactive data transformation system that integrates both desktop and VR environments, enabling direct manipulation of data through gestures. Our system allows users to perform essential data transformation operations using intuitive embodied interactions in VR and embedded gestures on the desktop, providing an alternative to traditional WIMP interfaces.
